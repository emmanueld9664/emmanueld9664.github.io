            <p>Context: The “Freedom Project” for SEP11 is all about using Javascript in a singular project to solve some problems. In this project, I spent time learning about my tool, and how to use it properly in the task that I had given myself, which was making a game of some kind.</p>
            <p>Content: My Project is a difficult boss fight against an enemy that has many tracking attacks and attacks that it swaps between like phases in real boss battles in videogames. I used Kaboom.JS, and I intended for it to give the player a challenge, as I see difficulty as a necessity in getting better at things.</p>
            <p>Reflection: While making my project, I came across a few challenges. Such as making my character fire attacks on delays, or making tracking attacks for the boss. Many of these issues I fixed as I continued learning and developing my game. A few of my takeaways were that I need to be better at time management. Another takeaway would be to think outside the box for finding solutions to my problems, as many issues I had could be fixed by thinking about it a different way rather than doing it in one wrong way continuously. My next steps are to definitely add more, or change a lot to my game to make it more unique, something I would say is something I made without outside influence. </p>
